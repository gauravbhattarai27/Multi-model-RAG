<u>Multi-Modal RAG System</u>
This project implements a Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System that integrates and retrieves data from various sources, including text, images, and tables, to generate coherent, contextually relevant responses.

<u>Key Components</u>
Framework: LangChain – Provides seamless integration and retrieval across multi-modal data sources, enabling efficient handling of diverse data inputs.
Database: FAISS – A fast and efficient vector database optimized for storing and retrieving embeddings, supporting high-performance multi-modal search.
Model: OpenAI – Utilizes OpenAI's advanced language models to enhance the quality and coherence of response generation.
